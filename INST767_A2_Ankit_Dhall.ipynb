              "[\"chief justice roberts president carter president clinton president bush president obama fellow americans and people of the world thank you we the citizens of america are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people together we will determine the course of america and the world for years to come we will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition they have been magnificent today’s ceremony however has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from washington dc and giving it back to you the american people for too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth politicians prospered – but the jobs left and the factories closed the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation’s capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land that all changes – starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment it belongs to you it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america this is your day this is your celebration and this the united states of america is your country what truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people january 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer everyone is listening to you now you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens americans want great schools for their children safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves these are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public but for too many of our citizens a different reality exists mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential this american carnage stops right here and stops right now we are one nation – and their pain is our pain  their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success  we share one heart one home and one glorious destiny the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans for many decades we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military we've defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions of dollars overseas while america's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay we’ve made other countries rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon one by one the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of american workers left behind the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world but that is the past and now we are looking only to the future we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power from this day forward a new vision will govern our land from this moment on it’s going to be america first every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs will be made to benefit american workers and american families we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs  protection will lead to great prosperity and strength i will fight for you with every breath in my body – and i will never ever let you down america will start winning again winning like never before we will bring back our jobs we will bring back our borders  we will bring back our wealth  and we will bring back our dreams we will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation we will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with american hands and american labor we will follow two simple rules buy american and hire american we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice the bible tells us “how good and pleasant it is when god’s people live together in unity” we must speak our minds openly debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity when america is united america is totally unstoppable there should be no fear – we are protected and we will always be protected we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and most importantly we are protected by god finally we must think big and dream even bigger in america we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it the time for empty talk is over now arrives the hour of action do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done  no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america we will not fail our country will thrive and prosper again we stand at the birth of a new millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies industries and technologies of tomorrow a new national pride will stir our souls lift our sights and heal our divisions it is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget that whether we are black or brown or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great american flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska they look up at the same night sky they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of

              " 'vice president cheney mr chief justice president carter president bush president clinton members of the united states congress reverend clergy distinguished guests fellow citizens on this day prescribed by law and marked by ceremony we celebrate the durable wisdom of our constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country i am grateful for the honor of this hour mindful of the consequential times in which we live and determined to fulfill the oath that i have sworn and you have witnessed at this second gathering our duties are defined not by the words i use but by the history we have seen together for a half a century america defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders after the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet years of repose years of sabbatical—and then there came a day of fire we have seen our vulnerability—and we have seen its deepest source for as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny—prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder—violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended borders and raise a mortal threat there is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant and that is the force of human freedom we are led by events and common sense to one conclusion the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands the best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world america’s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one from the day of our founding we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights and dignity and matchless value because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave advancing these ideals is the mission that created our nation it is the honorable achievement of our fathers now it is the urgent requirement of our nation’s security and the calling of our time so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world this is not primarily the task of arms though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary freedom by its nature must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities and when the soul of a nation finally speaks the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling our goal instead is to help others find their own voice attain their own freedom and make their own way the great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations the difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it america’s influence is not unlimited but fortunately for the oppressed america’s influence is considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom’s cause my most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats some have unwisely chosen to test america’s resolve and have found it firm we will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation the moral choice between oppression which is always wrong and freedom which is eternally right america will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains or that women welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies we will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people america’s belief in human dignity will guide our policies yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed in the long run there is no justice without freedom and there can be no human rights without human liberty some i know have questioned the global appeal of liberty—though this time in history four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen is an odd time for doubt americans of all people should never be surprised by the power of our ideals eventually the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul we do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery liberty will come to those who love it today america speaks anew to the peoples of the world all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the united states will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors when you stand for your liberty we will stand with you democratic reformers facing repression prison or exile can know america sees you for who you are the future leaders of your free country the rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as abraham lincoln did “those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under the rule of a just god cannot long retain it” the leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know to serve your people you must learn to trust them start on this journey of progress and justice and america will walk at your side and all the allies of the united states can know we honor your friendship we rely on your counsel and we depend on your help division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom’s enemies the concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies’ defeat today i also speak anew to my fellow citizens from all of you i have asked patience in the hard task of securing america which you have granted in good measure our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation tens of millions have achieved their freedom and as hope kindles hope millions more will find it by our efforts we have lit a fire as well—a fire in the minds of men it warms those who feel its power it burns those who fight its progress and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world a few americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause—in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy … the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments … the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives—and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice all americans have witnessed this idealism and some for the first time i ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes you have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers you have seen that life is fragile and evil is real and courage triumphs make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants larger than yourself—and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character america has need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home—the unfinished work of american freedom in a world moving toward liberty we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty in america’s ideal of freedom citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence this is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the homestead act the social security act and the gi bill of rights and now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time to give every american a stake in the promise and future of our country we will bring the highest standards to our schools and build an ownership society we will widen the ownership of homes and businesses retirement savings and health insurance—preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society by making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny we will give our fellow americans greater freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal in america’s ideal of freedom the public interest depends on private character—on integrity and tolerance toward others and the rule of conscience in our own lives self-government relies in the end on the governing of the self that edifice of character is built in families supported by communities with standards and sustained in our national life by the truths of sinai the sermon on the mount the words of the koran and the varied faiths of our people americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before—ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday today and forever in america’s ideal of freedom the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy and a heart for the weak liberty for all does not mean independence from one another our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love americans at our best value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth and our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time from the perspective of a single day including this day of dedication the issues and questions before our country are many from the viewpoint of centuries the questions that come to us are narrowed and few did our generation advance the cause of freedom and did our character bring credit to that cause these questions that judge us also unite us because americans of every party and background americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom we have known divisions which must be healed to move forward in great purposes—and i will strive in good faith to heal them yet those divisions do not define america we felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack and our response came like a single hand over a single heart and we can feel that same unity and pride whenever america acts for good and the victims of disaster are given hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captives are set free we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability it is human choices that move events not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation god moves and chooses as he wills we have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind the hunger in dark places the longing of the soul when our founders declared a new order of the ages when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner “freedom now”—they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled history has an ebb and flow of justice but history also has a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty when the declaration of independence was first read in public and the liberty bell was sounded in celebration a witness said “it rang as if it meant something” in our time it means something still america in this young century proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof renewed in our strength—tested but not weary—we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom may god bless you and may he watch over the united states of america ',\n",
              " 'i stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors i thank president bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition forty-four americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms at these moments america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents so it has been so it must be with this generation of americans that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet these are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that america\\'s decline is inevitable and that the next generation must lower its sights today i say to you that the challenges we face are real they are serious and they are many they will not be met easily or in a short span of time but know this america—they will be met on this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord on this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has come to set aside childish things the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the god-given promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness in reaffirming the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness is never a given it must be earned our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less it has not been the path for the faint-hearted—for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame rather it has been the risk-takers the doers the makers of things—some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom for us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life for us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth for us they fought and died in places like concord and gettysburg normandy and khe sahn time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction this is the journey we continue today we remain the most prosperous powerful nation on earth our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began our minds are no less inventive our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year our capacity remains undiminished but our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions—that time has surely passed starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking america for everywhere we look there is work to be done the state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act—not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth we will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology\\'s wonders to raise health care\\'s quality and lower its cost we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age all this we can do and all this we will do now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions—who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans their memories are short for they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works—whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified where the answer is yes we intend to move forward where the answer is no programs will end and those of us who manage the public\\'s dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control—and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good as for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals our founding fathers faced with perils we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expedience\\'s sake and so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that america is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and that we are ready to lead once more recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions they understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint we are the keepers of this legacy guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort—even greater cooperation and understanding between nations we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in afghanistan with old friends and former foes we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet we will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us and we will defeat you for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness we are a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus and non-believers we are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace to the muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society\\'s ills on the west know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist to the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the world\\'s resources without regard to effect for the world has changed and we must change with it as we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who at this very hour patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains they have something to tell us today just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves and yet at this moment—a moment that will define a generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all for as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours it is the firefighter\\'s courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parent\\'s willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate our challenges may be new the instruments with which we meet them may be new but those values upon which our success depends—hard work and honesty courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism—these things are old these things are true they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history what is demanded then is a return to these truths what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves our nation and the world duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task this is the price and the promise of citizenship this is the source of our confidence—the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed—why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath so let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled in the year of america\\'s birth in the coldest of months a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river the capital was abandoned the enemy was advancing the snow was stained with blood at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people \"let it be told to the future worldthat in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survivethat the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet [it]\" america in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words with hope and virtue let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come let it be said by our children\\'s children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god\\'s grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america ',\n",
              " \"president clinton distinguished guests and my fellow citizens the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history yet common in our country with a simple oath we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings as i begin i thank president clinton for his service to our nation and i thank vice president gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace i am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of america's leaders have come before me and so many will follow we have a place all of us in a long story a story we continue but whose end we will not see it is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess to defend but not to conquer it is the american story a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals the grandest of these ideals is an unfolding american promise that everyone belongs that everyone deserves a chance that no insignificant person was ever born americans are called upon to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws and though our nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed we must follow no other course through much of the last century america's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea now it is a seed upon the wind taking root in many nations our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country it is the inborn hope of our humanity an ideal we carry but do not own a trust we bear and pass along and even after nearly 225 years we have a long way yet to travel while many of our citizens prosper others doubt the promise even the justice of our own country the ambitions of some americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth and sometimes our differences run so deep it seems we share a continent but not a country we do not accept this and we will not allow it our unity our union is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation and this is my solemn pledge i will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity i know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in his image and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward america has never been united by blood or birth or soil we are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens every child must be taught these principles every citizen must uphold them and every immigrant by embracing these ideals makes our country more not less american today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility courage compassion and character america at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility a civil society demands from each of us good will and respect fair dealing and forgiveness some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stakes of our debates appear small but the stakes for america are never small if our country does not lead the cause of freedom it will not be led if we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism if we permit our economy to drift and decline the vulnerable will suffer most we must live up to the calling we share civility is not a tactic or a sentiment it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism of community over chaos this commitment if we keep it is a way to shared accomplishment america at its best is also courageous our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war when defending common dangers defined our common good now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us we must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations together we will reclaim america's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives we will reform social security and medicare sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working americans we will build our defenses beyond challenge lest weakness invite challenge and we will confront weapons of mass destruction so that a new century is spared new horrors the enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake america remains engaged in the world by history and by choice shaping a balance of power that favors freedom we will defend our allies and our interests we will show purpose without arrogance we will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength and to all nations we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth america at its best is compassionate in the quiet of american conscience we know that deep persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise whatever our views of its cause we can agree that children at risk are not at fault abandonment and abuse are not acts of god they are failures of love the proliferation of prisons however necessary is no substitute for hope and order in our souls where there is suffering there is duty americans in need are not strangers they are citizens not problems but priorities and all of us are diminished when any are hopeless government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health for civil rights and common schools yet compassion is the work of a nation not just a government some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer church and charity synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws many in our country do not know the pain of poverty but we can listen to those who do i can pledge our nation to a goal when we see that wounded traveler on the road to jericho we will not pass to the other side america at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats it is a call to conscience though it requires sacrifice it brings a deeper fulfillment we find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free our public interest depends on private character on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness on uncounted unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom sometimes in life we are called to do great things but as a saint of our times has said every day we are called to do small things with great love the most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone i will live and lead by these principles to advance my convictions with civility to pursue the public interest with courage to speak for greater justice and compassion to call for responsibility and try to live it as well in all of these ways i will bring the values of our history to the care of our times what you do is as important as anything government does i ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort to defend needed reforms against easy attacks to serve your nation beginning with your neighbor i ask you to be citizens citizens not spectators citizens not subjects responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character americans are generous and strong and decent not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves when this spirit of citizenship is missing no government program can replace it when this spirit is present no wrong can stand against it after the declaration of independence was signed virginia statesman john page wrote to thomas jefferson we know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm much time has passed since jefferson arrived for his inauguration the years and changes accumulate but the themes of this day he would know our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity we are not this story's author who fills time and eternity with his purpose yet his purpose is achieved in our duty and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another never tiring never yielding never finishing we renew that purpose today to make our country more just and generous to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life this work continues this story goes on and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm god bless you all and god bless america \"]"

              "'fellow citizens of the senate and the house of representatives among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order and received on the fourteenth day of the present month on the one hand i was summoned by my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love from a retreat which i had chosen with the fondest predilection and in my flattering hopes with an immutable decision as the asylum of my declining years a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time on the other hand the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications could not but overwhelm with dispondence one who inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpractised in the duties of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of eve ry circumstance by which it might be affected all i dare hope is that if in executing this task i have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me my error will be palliated by the motives which misled me and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated such being the impressions under which i have in obedience to the public summons repaired to the present station it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides in the councils of nations and whose providential aids can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge in tendering this homage to the great author of every public and private good i assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own nor those of my fellow-citizens at large less than either no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the people of the united states every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted cannot be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage these reflections arising out of the present crisis have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed you will join with me i trust in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence by the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president \"to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient\" the circumstances under which i now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject farther than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled and which in defining your powers designates the objects to which your attention is to be given it will be more consistent with those circumstances and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular measures the tribute that is due to the talents the rectitude and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them in these honorable qualifications i behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments no seperate views nor party animosities will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests so on another that the foundations of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality and the pre-eminence of a free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world i dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness between duty and advantage between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered as deeply perhaps as finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject in which i could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities i shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good for i assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government or which ought to await the future lessons of experience a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted to the preceeding observations i have one to add which will be most properly addressed to the house of representatives it concerns myself and will therefore be as brief as possible when i was first honoured with a call into the service of my country then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties the light in which i contemplated my duty required that i should renounce every pecuniary compensation from this resolution i have in no instance departed and being still under the impressions which produced it i must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which i am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together i shall take my present leave but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favour the american people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility and dispositions for deciding with unparellelled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views the temperate consultations and the wise measures on which the success of this government must depend'"

notification was transmitted by your order and received on the fourteenth day of the present month on the one hand i was summoned by my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love from a retreat which i had chosen with the fondest predilection and in my flattering hopes with an immutable decision as the asylum of my declining years a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time on the other hand the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications could not but overwhelm with dispondence one who inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpractised in the duties of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of eve ry circumstance by which it might be affected all i dare hope is that if in executing this task i have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me my error will be palliated by the motives which misled me and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated such being the impressions under which i have in obedience to the public summons repaired to the present station it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides in the councils of nations

              " \"chief justice roberts president carter president clinton president bush president obama fellow americans and people of the world thank you we the citizens of america are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people together we will determine the course of america and the world for years to come we will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition they have been magnificent today’s ceremony however has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from washington dc and giving it back to you the american people for too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth politicians prospered – but the jobs left and the factories closed the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation’s capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land that all changes – starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment it belongs to you it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america this is your day this is your celebration and this the united states of america is your country what truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people january 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer everyone is listening to you now you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens americans want great schools for their children safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves these are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public but for too many of our citizens a different reality exists mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential this american carnage stops right here and stops right now we are one nation – and their pain is our pain  their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success  we share one heart one home and one glorious destiny the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans for many decades we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military we've defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions of dollars overseas while america's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay we’ve made other countries rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon one by one the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of american workers left behind the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world but that is the past and now we are looking only to the future we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power from this day forward a new vision will govern our land from this moment on it’s going to be america first every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs will be made to benefit american workers and american families we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs  protection will lead to great prosperity and strength i will fight for you with every breath in my body – and i will never ever let you down america will start winning again winning like never before we will bring back our jobs we will bring back our borders  we will bring back our wealth  and we will bring back our dreams we will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation we will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with american hands and american labor we will follow two simple rules buy american and hire american we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice the bible tells us “how good and pleasant it is when god’s people live together in unity” we must speak our minds openly debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity when america is united america is totally unstoppable there should be no fear – we are protected and we will always be protected we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and most importantly we are protected by god finally we must think big and dream even bigger in america we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it the time for empty talk is over now arrives the hour of action do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done  no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america we will not fail our country will thrive and prosper again we stand at the birth of a new millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies industries and technologies of tomorrow a new national pride will stir our souls lift our sights and heal our divisions it is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget that whether we are black or brown or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great american flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska they look up at the same night sky they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator so to all americans in every city near and far small and large from mountain to mountain and from ocean to ocean hear these words you will never be ignored again your voice your hopes and your dreams will define our american destiny and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way together we will make america strong again we will make america wealthy again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and yes together we will make america great again thank you god bless you and god bless america \",\n",
              " 'vice president cheney mr chief justice president carter president bush president clinton members of the united states congress reverend clergy distinguished guests fellow citizens on this day prescribed by law and marked by ceremony we celebrate the durable wisdom of our constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country i am grateful for the honor of this hour mindful of the consequential times in which we live and determined to fulfill the oath that i have sworn and you have witnessed at this second gathering our duties are defined not by the words i use but by the history we have seen together for a half a century america defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders after the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet years of repose years of sabbatical—and then there came a day of fire we have seen our vulnerability—and we have seen its deepest source for as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny—prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder—violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended borders and raise a mortal threat there is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant and that is the force of human freedom we are led by events and common sense to one conclusion the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands the best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world america’s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one from the day of our founding we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights and dignity and matchless value because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave advancing these ideals is the mission that created our nation it is the honorable achievement of our fathers now it is the urgent requirement of our nation’s security and the calling of our time so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world this is not primarily the task of arms though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary freedom by its nature must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities and when the soul of a nation finally speaks the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling our goal instead is to help others find their own voice attain their own freedom and make their own way the great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations the difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it america’s influence is not unlimited but fortunately for the oppressed america’s influence is considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom’s cause my most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats some have unwisely chosen to test america’s resolve and have found it firm we will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation the moral choice between oppression which is always wrong and freedom which is eternally right america will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains or that women welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies we will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people america’s belief in human dignity will guide our policies yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed in the long run there is no justice without freedom and there can be no human rights without human liberty some i know have questioned the global appeal of liberty—though this time in history four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen is an odd time for doubt americans of all people should never be surprised by the power of our ideals eventually the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul we do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery liberty will come to those who love it today america speaks anew to the peoples of the world all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the united states will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors when you stand for your liberty we will stand with you democratic reformers facing repression prison or exile can know america sees you for who you are the future leaders of your free country the rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as abraham lincoln did “those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under the rule of a just god cannot long retain it” the leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know to serve your people you must learn to trust them start on this journey of progress and justice and america will walk at your side and all the allies of the united states can know we honor your friendship we rely on your counsel and we depend on your help division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom’s enemies the concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies’ defeat today i also speak anew to my fellow citizens from all of you i have asked patience in the hard task of securing america which you have granted in good measure our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation tens of millions have achieved their freedom and as hope kindles hope millions more will find it by our efforts we have lit a fire as well—a fire in the minds of men it warms those who feel its power it burns those who fight its progress and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world a few americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause—in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy … the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments … the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives—and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice all americans have witnessed this idealism and some for the first time i ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes you have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers you have seen that life is fragile and evil is real and courage triumphs make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants larger than yourself—and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character america has need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home—the unfinished work of american freedom in a world moving toward liberty we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty in america’s ideal of freedom citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence this is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the homestead act the social security act and the gi bill of rights and now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time to give every american a stake in the promise and future of our country we will bring the highest standards to our schools and build an ownership society we will widen the ownership of homes and businesses retirement savings and health insurance—preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society by making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny we will give our fellow americans greater freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal in america’s ideal of freedom the public interest depends on private character—on integrity and tolerance toward others and the rule of conscience in our own lives self-government relies in the end on the governing of the self that edifice of character is built in families supported by communities with standards and sustained in our national life by the truths of sinai the sermon on the mount the words of the koran and the varied faiths of our people americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before—ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday today and forever in america’s ideal of freedom the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy and a heart for the weak liberty for all does not mean independence from one another our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love americans at our best value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth and our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time from the perspective of a single day including this day of dedication the issues and questions before our country are many from the viewpoint of centuries the questions that come to us are narrowed and few did our generation advance the cause of freedom and did our character bring credit to that cause these questions that judge us also unite us because americans of every party and background americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom we have known divisions which must be healed to move forward in great purposes—and i will strive in good faith to heal them yet those divisions do not define america we felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack and our response came like a single hand over a single heart and we can feel that same unity and pride whenever america acts for good and the victims of disaster are given hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captives are set free we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability it is human choices that move events not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation god moves and chooses as he wills we have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind the hunger in dark places the longing of the soul when our founders declared a new order of the ages when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner “freedom now”—they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled history has an ebb and flow of justice but history also has a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty when the declaration of independence was first read in public and the liberty bell was sounded in celebration a witness said “it rang as if it meant something” in our time it means something still america in this young century proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof renewed in our strength—tested but not weary—we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom may god bless you and may he watch over the united states of america ',\n",
              " 'i stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors i thank president bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition forty-four americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms at these moments america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents so it has been so it must be with this generation of americans that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet these are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that america\\'s decline is inevitable and that the next generation must lower its sights today i say to you that the challenges we face are real they are serious and they are many they will not be met easily or in a short span of time but know this america—they will be met on this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord on this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has come to set aside childish things the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the god-given promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness in reaffirming the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness is never a given it must be earned our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less it has not been the path for the faint-hearted—for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame rather it has been the risk-takers the doers the makers of things—some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom for us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life for us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth for us they fought and died in places like concord and gettysburg normandy and khe sahn time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction this is the journey we continue today we remain the most prosperous powerful nation on earth our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began our minds are no less inventive our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year our capacity remains undiminished but our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions—that time has surely passed starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking america for everywhere we look there is work to be done the state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act—not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth we will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology\\'s wonders to raise health care\\'s quality and lower its cost we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age all this we can do and all this we will do now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions—who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans their memories are short for they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works—whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified where the answer is yes we intend to move forward where the answer is no programs will end and those of us who manage the public\\'s dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control—and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good as for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals our founding fathers faced with perils we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expedience\\'s sake and so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that america is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and that we are ready to lead once more recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions they understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint we are the keepers of this legacy guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort—even greater cooperation and understanding between nations we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in afghanistan with old friends and former foes we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet we will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us and we will defeat you for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness we are a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus and non-believers we are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace to the muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society\\'s ills on the west know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist to the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the world\\'s resources without regard to effect for the world has changed and we must change with it as we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who at this very hour patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains they have something to tell us today just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves and yet at this moment—a moment that will define a generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all for as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours it is the firefighter\\'s courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parent\\'s willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate our challenges may be new the instruments with which we meet them may be new but those values upon which our success depends—hard work and honesty courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism—these things are old these things are true they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history what is demanded then is a return to these truths what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves our nation and the world duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task this is the price and the promise of citizenship this is the source of our confidence—the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed—why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath so let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled in the year of america\\'s birth in the coldest of months a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river the capital was abandoned the enemy was advancing the snow was stained with blood at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people \"let it be told to the future worldthat in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survivethat the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet [it]\" america in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words with hope and virtue let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come let it be said by our children\\'s children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god\\'s grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america ',\n",
              " \"president clinton distinguished guests and my fellow citizens the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history yet common in our country with a simple oath we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings as i begin i thank president clinton for his service to our nation and i thank vice president gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace i am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of america's leaders have come before me and so many will follow we have a place all of us in a long story a story we continue but whose end we will not see it is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess to defend but not to conquer it is the american story a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals the grandest of these ideals is an unfolding american promise that everyone belongs that everyone deserves a chance that no insignificant person was ever born americans are called upon to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws and though our nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed we must follow no other course through much of the last century america's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea now it is a seed upon the wind taking root in many nations our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country it is the inborn hope of our humanity an ideal we carry but do not own a trust we bear and pass along and even after nearly 225 years we have a long way yet to travel while many of our citizens prosper others doubt the promise even the justice of our own country the ambitions of some americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth and sometimes our differences run so deep it seems we share a continent but not a country we do not accept this and we will not allow it our unity our union is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation and this is my solemn pledge i will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity i know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in his image and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward america has never been united by blood or birth or soil we are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens every child must be taught these principles every citizen must uphold them and every immigrant by embracing these ideals makes our country more not less american today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility courage compassion and character america at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility a civil society demands from each of us good will and respect fair dealing and forgiveness some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stakes of our debates appear small but the stakes for america are never small if our country does not lead the cause of freedom it will not be led if we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism if we permit our economy to drift and decline the vulnerable will suffer most we must live up to the calling we share civility is not a tactic or a sentiment it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism of community over chaos this commitment if we keep it is a way to shared accomplishment america at its best is also courageous our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war when defending common dangers defined our common good now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us we must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations together we will reclaim america's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives we will reform social security and medicare sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working americans we will build our defenses beyond challenge lest weakness invite challenge and we will confront weapons of mass destruction so that a new century is spared new horrors the enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake america remains engaged in the world by history and by choice shaping a balance of power that favors freedom we will defend our allies and our interests we will show purpose without arrogance we will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength and to all nations we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth america at its best is compassionate in the quiet of american conscience we know that deep persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise whatever our views of its cause we can agree that children at risk are not at fault abandonment and abuse are not acts of god they are failures of love the proliferation of prisons however necessary is no substitute for hope and order in our souls where there is suffering there is duty americans in need are not strangers they are citizens not problems but priorities and all of us are diminished when any are hopeless government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health for civil rights and common schools yet compassion is the work of a nation not just a government some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer church and charity synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws many in our country do not know the pain of poverty but we can listen to those who do i can pledge our nation to a goal when we see that wounded traveler on the road to jericho we will not pass to the other side america at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats it is a call to conscience though it requires sacrifice it brings a deeper fulfillment we find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free our public interest depends on private character on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness on uncounted unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom sometimes in life we are called to do great things but as a saint of our times has said every day we are called to do small things with great love the most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone i will live and lead by these principles to advance my convictions with civility to pursue the public interest with courage to speak for greater justice and compassion to call for responsibility and try to live it as well in all of these ways i will bring the values of our history to the care of our times what you do is as important as anything government does i ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort to defend needed reforms against easy attacks to serve your nation beginning with your neighbor i ask you to be citizens citizens not spectators citizens not subjects responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character americans are generous and strong and decent not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves when this spirit of citizenship is missing no government program can replace it when this spirit is present no wrong can stand against it after the declaration of independence was signed virginia statesman john page wrote to thomas jefferson we know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm much time has passed since jefferson arrived for his inauguration the years and changes accumulate but the themes of this day he would know our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity we are not this story's author who fills time and eternity with his purpose yet his purpose is achieved in our duty and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another never tiring never yielding never finishing we renew that purpose today to make our country more just and generous to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life this work continues this story goes on and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm god bless you all and god bless america \"]"

more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time on the other hand the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications could not but overwhelm with dispondence one who inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpractised in the duties of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of eve ry circumstance by which it might be affected all i dare hope is that if in executing this task i have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me my error will be palliated by the motives which misled me and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated such being the impressions under which i have in obedience to the public summons repaired to the present station it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides in the councils of nations and whose providential aids can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge in tendering this homage to the great author of every public and private good i assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own nor those of my fellow-citizens at large less than either no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the people of the united states every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted cannot be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage these reflections arising out of the present crisis have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed you will join with me i trust in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence by the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president \"to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient\" the circumstances under which i now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject farther than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled and which in defining your powers designates the objects to which your attention is to be given it will be more consistent with those circumstances and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular measures the tribute that is due to the talents the rectitude and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them in these honorable qualifications i behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments no seperate views nor party animosities will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests so on another that the foundations of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality and the pre-eminence of a free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world i dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness between duty and advantage between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered as deeply perhaps as finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject in which i could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities i shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good for i assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government or which ought to await the future lessons of experience a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted to the preceeding observations i have one to add which will be most properly addressed to the house of representatives it concerns myself and will therefore be as brief as possible when i was first honoured with a call into the service of my country then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties the light in which i contemplated my duty required that i should renounce every pecuniary compensation from this resolution i have in no instance departed and being still under the impressions which produced it i must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which i am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together i shall take my present leave but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favour the american people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility and dispositions for deciding with unparellelled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views the temperate consultations and the wise measures on which the success of this government must depend

entrusted, to, the, hands, of, the, american, people, besides, the, ordinary, objects, submitted, to, your, care, it, will, remain, with, your, judgment, to, decide, how, far, an, exercise, of, the, occasional, power, delegated, by, the, fifth, article, of, the, constitution, is, rendered, expedient, at, the, present, juncture, by, the, nature, of, objections, which, have, been, urged, against, the, system, or, by, the, degree, of, inquietude, which, has, given, birth, to, them, instead, of, undertaking, particular, recommendations, on, this, subject, in, which, i, could, be, guided, by, no, lights, derived, from, official, opportunities, i, shall, again, give, way, to, my, entire, confidence, in, your, discernment, and, pursuit, of, the, public, good, for, i, assure, myself, that, whilst, you, carefully, avoid, every, alteration, which, might, endanger, the, benefits, of, an, united, and, effective, government, or, which, ought, to, await, the, future, lessons, of, experience, a, reverence, for, the, characteristic, rights, of, freemen, and, a, regard, for, the, public, harmony, will, sufficiently, influence, your, deliberations, on, the, question, how, far, the, former, can, be, more, impregnably, fortified, or, the, latter, be, safely, and, advantageously, promoted, to, the, preceeding, observations, i, have, one, to, add, which, will, be, most, properly, addressed, to, the, house, of, representatives, it, concerns, myself, and, will, therefore, be, as, brief, as, possible, when, i, was, first, honoured, with, a, call, into, the, service, of, my, country, then, on, the, eve, of, an, arduous, struggle, for, its, liberties, the, light, in, which, i, contemplated, my, duty, required, that, i, should, renounce, every, pecuniary, compensation, from, this, resolution, i, have, in, no, instance, departed, and, being, still, under, the, impressions, which, produced, it, i, must, decline, as, inapplicable, to, myself, any, share, in, the, personal, emoluments, which, may, be, indispensably, included, in, a, permanent, provision, for, the, executive, department, and, must, accordingly, pray, that, the, pecuniary, estimates, for, the, station, in, which, i, am, placed, may, during, my, continuance, in, it, be, limited, to, such, actual, expenditures, as, the, public, good, may, be, thought, to, require, having, thus, imparted, to, you, my, sentiments, as, they, have, been, awakened, by, the, occasion, which, brings, us, together, i, shall, take, my, present, leave, but, not, without, resorting, once, more, to, the, benign, parent, of, the, human, race, in, humble, supplication, that, since, he, has, been, pleased, to, favour, the, american, people, with, opportunities, for, deliberating, in, perfect, tranquility, and, dispositions, for, deciding, with, unparellelled, unanimity, on, a, form, of, government, for, the, security, of, their, union, and, the, advancement, of, their, happiness, so, his, divine, blessing, may, be,

            "|chief justice roberts president carter president clinton president bush president obama fellow americans and people of the world thank you we the citizens of america are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people together we will determine the course of america and the world for years to come we will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition they have been magnificent today’s ceremony however has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from washington dc and giving it back to you the american people for too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth politicians prospered – but the jobs left and the factories closed the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation’s capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land that all changes – starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment it belongs to you it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america this is your day this is your celebration and this the united states of america is your country what truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people january 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer everyone is listening to you now you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens americans want great schools for their children safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves these are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public but for too many of our citizens a different reality exists mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential this american carnage stops right here and stops right now we are one nation – and their pain is our pain  their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success  we share one heart one home and one glorious destiny the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans for many decades we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military we've defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions of dollars overseas while america's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay we’ve made other countries rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon one by one the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of american workers left behind the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world but that is the past and now we are looking only to the future we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power from this day forward a new vision will govern our land from this moment on it’s going to be america first every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on foreign affairs will be made to benefit american workers and american families we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs  protection will lead to great prosperity and strength i will fight for you with every breath in my body – and i will never ever let you down america will start winning again winning like never before we will bring back our jobs we will bring back our borders  we will bring back our wealth  and we will bring back our dreams we will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation we will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with american hands and american labor we will follow two simple rules buy american and hire american we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice the bible tells us “how good and pleasant it is when god’s people live together in unity” we must speak our minds openly debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity when america is united america is totally unstoppable there should be no fear – we are protected and we will always be protected we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and most importantly we are protected by god finally we must think big and dream even bigger in america we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it the time for empty talk is over now arrives the hour of action do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done  no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america we will not fail our country will thrive and prosper again we stand at the birth of a new millennium ready to unlock the mysteries of space to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies industries and technologies of tomorrow a new national pride will stir our souls lift our sights and heal our divisions it is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget that whether we are black or brown or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great american flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska they look up at the same night sky they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by

fellow, americans, and, people, of, the, world, thank, you, we, the, citizens, of, america, are, now, joined, in, a, great, national, effort, to, rebuild, our, country, and, to, restore, its, promise, for, all, of, our, people, together, we, will, determine, the, course, of, america, and, the, world, for, years, to, come, we, will, face, challenges, we, will, confront, hardships, but, we, will, get, the, job, done, every, four, years, we, gather, on, these, steps, to, carry, out, the, orderly, and, peaceful, transfer, of, power, and, we, are, grateful, to, president, obama, and, first, lady, michelle, obama, for, their, gracious, aid, throughout, this, transition, they, have, been, magnificent, today, s, ceremony, however, has, very, special, meaning, because, today, we, are, not, merely, transferring, power, from, one, administration, to, another, or, from, one, party, to, another, but, we, are, transferring, power, from, washington, dc, and, giving, it, back, to, you, the, american, people, for, too, long, a, small, group, in, our, nation, s, capital, has, reaped, the, rewards, of, government, while, the, people, have, borne, the, cost, washington, flourished, but, the, people, did, not, share, in, its, wealth, politicians, prospered, but, the, jobs, left, and, the, factories, closed, the, establishment, protected, itself, but, not, the, citizens, of, our, country, their, victories, have, not, been, your, victories, their, triumphs, have, not, been, your, triumphs, and, while, they, celebrated, in, our, nation, s, capital, there, was, little, to, celebrate, for, struggling, families, all, across, our, land, that, all, changes, starting, right, here, and, right, now, because, this, moment, is, your, moment, it, belongs, to, you, it, belongs, to, everyone, gathered, here, today, and, everyone, watching, all, across, america, this, is, your, day, this, is, your, celebration, and, this, the, united, states, of, america, is, your, country, what, truly, matters, is, not, which, party, controls, our, government, but, whether, our, government, is, controlled, by, the, people, january, 20th, 2017, will, be, remembered, as, the, day, the, people, became, the, rulers, of, this, nation, again, the, forgotten, men, and, women, of, our, country, will, be, forgotten, no, longer, everyone, is, listening, to, you, now, you, came, by, the, tens, of, millions, to, become, part, of, a, historic, movement, the, likes, of, which, the, world, has, never, seen, before, at, the, center, of, this, movement, is, a, crucial, conviction, that, a, nation, exists, to, serve, its, citizens, americans, want, great, schools, for, their, children, safe, neighborhoods, for, their, families, and, good, jobs, for, themselves, these, are, the, just, and, reasonable, demands, of, a, righteous, public, but, for, too, many, of, our, citizens, a, different, reality, exists, mothers, and, children, trapped, in, poverty, in, our, inner, cities, rusted, out, factories, scattered, like, tombstones, across, the, landscape, of, our, nation, an, education, system, flush, with, cash, but, which, leaves, our, young, and, beautiful, students, deprived, of, knowledge, and, the, crime, and, gangs, and, drugs, that, have, stolen, too, many, lives, and, robbed, our, country, of, so, much, unrealized, potential, this, american, carnage, stops, right, here, and, stops, right, now, we, are, one, nation, and, their, pain, is, our, pain, their, dreams, are, our, dreams, and, their, success, will, be, our, success, we, share, one, heart, one, home, and, one, glorious, destiny, the, oath, of, office, i, take, today, is, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, all, americans, for, many, decades, we, ve, enriched, foreign, industry, at, the, expense, of, american, industry, subsidized, the, armies, of, other, countries, while, allowing, for, the, very, sad, depletion, of, our, military, we, ve, defended, other, nation, s, borders, while, refusing, to, defend, our, own, and, spent, trillions, of, dollars, overseas, while, america, s, infrastructure, has, fallen, into, disrepair, and, decay, we, ve, made, other, countries, rich, while, the, wealth, strength, and, confidence, of, our, country, has, disappeared, over, the, horizon, one, by, one, the, factories, shuttered, and, left, our, shores, with, not, even, a, thought, about, the, millions, upon, millions, of, american, workers, left, behind, the, wealth, of, our, middle, class, has, been, ripped, from, their, homes, and, then, redistributed, across, the, entire, world, but, that, is, the, past, and, now, we, are, looking, only, to, the, future, we, assembled, here, today, are, issuing, a, new, decree, to, be, heard, in, every, city, in, every, foreign, capital, and, in, every, hall, of, power,

bring, back, our, dreams, we, will, build, new, roads, and, highways, and, bridges, and, airports, and, tunnels, and, railways, all, across, our, wonderful, nation, we, will, get, our, people, off,

not, seek, to, impose, our, way, of, life, on, anyone, but, rather, to, let, it, shine, as, an, example, for, everyone, to, follow, we, will, reinforce, old, alliances, and, form, new, ones, and, unite, the, civilized, world, against, radical, islamic, terrorism, which, we, will, eradicate, completely, from, the, face, of, the, earth, at, the, bedrock, of, our, politics, will, be, a, total,

protected, we, will, be, protected, by, the, great, men, and, women, of, our, military, and, law, enforcement, and, most, importantly, we, are, protected, by, god, finally, we, must, think, big, and, dream, even, bigger, in, america, we, understand, that, a, nation, is, only, living, as, long, as, it, is, striving, we, will, no, longer, accept, politicians, who, are, all, talk, and, no, action,

            "|vice president cheney mr chief justice president carter president bush president clinton members of the united states congress reverend clergy distinguished guests fellow citizens on this day prescribed by law and marked by ceremony we celebrate the durable wisdom of our constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country i am grateful for the honor of this hour mindful of the consequential times in which we live and determined to fulfill the oath that i have sworn and you have witnessed at this second gathering our duties are defined not by the words i use but by the history we have seen together for a half a century america defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders after the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet years of repose years of sabbatical—and then there came a day of fire we have seen our vulnerability—and we have seen its deepest source for as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny—prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder—violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended borders and raise a mortal threat there is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant and that is the force of human freedom we are led by events and common sense to one conclusion the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands the best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world america’s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one from the day of our founding we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights and dignity and matchless value because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave advancing these ideals is the mission that created our nation it is the honorable achievement of our fathers now it is the urgent requirement of our nation’s security and the calling of our time so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world this is not primarily the task of arms though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary freedom by its nature must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities and when the soul of a nation finally speaks the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling our goal instead is to help others find their own voice attain their own freedom and make their own way the great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations the difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it america’s influence is not unlimited but fortunately for the oppressed america’s influence is considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom’s cause my most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats some have unwisely chosen to test america’s resolve and have found it firm we will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation the moral choice between oppression which is always wrong and freedom which is eternally right america will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains or that women welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies we will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people america’s belief in human dignity will guide our policies yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed in the long run there is no justice without freedom and there can be no human rights without human liberty some i know have questioned the global appeal of liberty—though this time in history four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen is an odd time for doubt americans of all people should never be surprised by the power of our ideals eventually the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul we do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery liberty will come to those who love it today america speaks anew to the peoples of the world all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the united states will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors when you stand for your liberty we will stand with you democratic reformers facing repression prison or exile can know america sees you for who you are the future leaders of your free country the rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as abraham lincoln did “those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under the rule of a just god cannot long retain it” the leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know to serve your people you must learn to trust them start on this journey of progress and justice and america will walk at your side and all the allies of the united states can know we honor your friendship we rely on your counsel and we depend on your help division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom’s enemies the concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies’ defeat today i also speak anew to my fellow citizens from all of you i have asked patience in the hard task of securing america which you have granted in good measure our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation tens of millions have achieved their freedom and as hope kindles hope millions more will find it by our efforts we have lit a fire as well—a fire in the minds of men it warms those who feel its power it burns those who fight its progress and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world a few americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause—in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy … the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments … the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives—and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice all americans have witnessed this idealism and some for the first time i ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes you have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers you have seen that life is fragile and evil is real and courage triumphs make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants larger than yourself—and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character america has need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home—the unfinished work of american freedom in a world moving toward liberty we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty in america’s ideal of freedom citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence this is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the homestead act the social security act and the gi bill of rights and now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time to give every american a stake in the promise and future of our country we will bring the highest standards to our schools and build an ownership society we will widen the ownership of homes and businesses retirement savings and health insurance—preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society by making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny we will give our fellow americans greater freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal in america’s ideal of freedom the public interest depends on private character—on integrity and tolerance toward others and the rule of conscience in our own lives self-government relies in the end on the governing of the self that edifice of character is built in families supported by communities with standards and sustained in our national life by the truths of sinai the sermon on the mount the words of the koran and the varied faiths of our people americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before—ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday today and forever in america’s ideal of freedom the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy and a heart for the weak liberty for all does not mean independence from one another our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love americans at our best value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth and our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time from the perspective of a single day including this day of dedication the issues and questions before our country are many from the viewpoint of centuries the questions that come to us are narrowed and few did our generation advance the cause of freedom and did our character bring credit to that cause these questions that judge us also unite us because americans of every party and background americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom we have known divisions which must be healed to move forward in great purposes—and i will strive in good faith to heal them yet those divisions do not define america we felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack and our response came like a single hand over a single heart and we can feel that same unity and pride whenever america acts for good and the victims of disaster are given hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captives are set free we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability it is human choices that move events not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation god moves and chooses as he wills we have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind the hunger in dark places the longing of the soul when our founders declared a new order of the ages when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner “freedom now”—they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled history has an ebb and flow of justice but history also has a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty when the declaration of independence was first read in public and the liberty bell was sounded in celebration a witness said “it rang as if it meant something” in our time it means something still america in this young century proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof renewed in our strength—tested but not weary—we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom may god bless you and may he watch over the united states of america

hour, mindful, of, the, consequential, times, in, which, we, live, and, determined, to, fulfill, the, oath, that, i, have, sworn, and, you, have, witnessed, at, this, second, gathering, our, duties, are, defined, not, by, the, words, i, use, but, by, the, history, we, have, seen, together, for, a, half, a, century, america, defended, our, own, freedom, by, standing, watch, on, distant, borders, after, the, shipwreck, of, communism, came, years, of, relative, quiet, years, of, repose, years, of, sabbatical, and, then, there, came, a, day, of, fire, we, have, seen, our, vulnerability, and, we, have, seen, its, deepest, source, for, as, long, as, whole, regions, of, the, world, simmer, in, resentment, and, tyranny, prone, to, ideologies, that, feed, hatred, and, excuse, murder, violence, will, gather, and, multiply, in, destructive, power, and, cross, the, most, defended, borders, and, raise, a, mortal, threat, there, is, only, one, force, of, history, that, can, break, the, reign, of, hatred, and, resentment, and, expose, the, pretensions, of, tyrants, and, reward, the, hopes, of, the, decent, and, tolerant, and, that, is, the, force, of, human, freedom, we, are, led, by, events, and, common, sense, to, one, conclusion, the, survival, of, liberty, in, our, land, increasingly, depends, on, the, success, of, liberty, in, other, lands, the, best, hope, for, peace, in, our, world, is, the, expansion, of, freedom, in, all, the, world, america, s, vital, interests, and, our, deepest, beliefs, are, now, one, from, the, day, of, our, founding, we, have, proclaimed, that, every, man, and, woman, on, this, earth, has, rights, and, dignity, and, matchless, value, because, they, bear, the, image, of, the, maker, of, heaven, and, earth, across, the, generations, we, have, proclaimed, the, imperative, of, self, government, because, no, one, is, fit, to, be, a, master, and, no, one, deserves, to, be, a, slave, advancing, these, ideals, is, the, mission, that, created, our, nation, it, is, the, honorable, achievement, of, our, fathers, now, it, is, the, urgent, requirement, of, our, nation, s, security, and, the, calling, of, our, time, so, it, is, the, policy, of, the, united, states, to, seek, and, support, the, growth, of, democratic, movements, and, institutions, in, every, nation, and, culture, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, ending, tyranny, in, our, world, this, is, not, primarily, the, task, of, arms, though, we, will, defend, ourselves, and, our, friends, by, force, of, arms, when, necessary, freedom, by, its, nature, must, be, chosen, and, defended, by, citizens, and, sustained, by, the, rule, of, law, and, the, protection, of, minorities, and, when, the, soul, of, a, nation, finally, speaks, the, institutions, that, arise, may, reflect, customs, and, traditions, very, different, from, our, own, america, will, not, impose, our, own, style, of, government, on, the, unwilling, our, goal, instead, is, to, help, others, find, their, own, voice, attain, their, own, freedom, and, make, their, own, way, the, great, objective, of, ending, tyranny, is, the, concentrated, work, of, generations, the, difficulty, of, the, task, is, no, excuse, for, avoiding, it, america, s, influence, is, not, unlimited, but, fortunately, for, the, oppressed, america, s, influence, is, considerable, and, we, will, use, it, confidently, in, freedom, s, cause, my, most, solemn, duty, is, to, protect, this, nation, and, its, people, from, further, attacks, and, emerging, threats, some, have, unwisely, chosen, to, test, america, s, resolve, and, have, found, it, firm, we, will, persistently, clarify, the, choice, before, every, ruler, and, every, nation, the, moral, choice, between, oppression, which, is, always, wrong, and, freedom, which, is, eternally, right, america, will, not, pretend, that, jailed, dissidents, prefer, their, chains, or, that, women, welcome, humiliation, and, servitude, or, that, any, human, being, aspires, to, live, at, the, mercy, of, bullies, we, will, encourage, reform, in, other, governments, by, making, clear, that, success, in, our, relations, will, require, the, decent, treatment, of, their, own, people, america, s, belief, in, human, dignity, will, guide, our, policies, yet, rights, must, be, more, than, the, grudging, concessions, of, dictators, they, are, secured, by, free, dissent, and, the, participation, of, the, governed, in, the, long, run, there, is, no, justice, without, freedom, and, there, can, be, no, human, rights, without, human, liberty, some, i, know, have, questioned, the, global, appeal, of, liberty, though, this, time, in, history, four, decades, defined, by, the, swiftest, advance, of, freedom, ever, seen, is, an, odd, time, for, doubt, americans, of, all, people, should, never, be, surprised, by, the, power, of, our, ideals, eventually, the, call, of, freedom, comes, to, every, mind, and, every, soul, we, do, not, accept, the, existence, of, permanent, tyranny, because, we, do, not, accept, the, possibility, of, permanent, slavery, liberty, will, come, to, those, who, love, it, today, america, speaks, anew, to, the, peoples, of, the, world, all, who, live, in, tyranny, and, hopelessness, can, know, the, united, states, will, not, ignore, your, oppression, or, excuse, your, oppressors, when, you, stand, for, your, liberty, we, will, stand, with, you, democratic, reformers, facing, repression, prison, or, exile, can, know, america, sees, you, for, who, you, are, the, future, leaders, of, your, free, country, the, rulers, of, outlaw, regimes, can, know, that, we, still, believe, as, abraham, lincoln, did, those, who, deny, freedom, to, others, deserve, it, not, for, themselves, and, under, the, rule, of, a, just, god, cannot, long, retain, it, the, leaders, of, governments, with, long, habits, of, control, need, to, know, to, serve, your, people, you, must, learn, to, trust, them, start, on, this, journey, of, progress, and, justice, and, america, will, walk, at, your, side, and, all, the, allies, of, the, united, states, can, know, we, honor, your, friendship, we, rely, on, your, counsel, and, we, depend, on, your, help, division, among, free, nations, is, a, primary, goal, of, freedom, s, enemies, the, concerted, effort, of, free, nations, to, promote, democracy, is, a, prelude, to, our, enemies, defeat, today, i, also, speak, anew, to, my, fellow, citizens, from, all, of, you, i, have, asked, patience, in, the, hard, task, of, securing, america, which, you, have, granted, in, good, measure, our, country, has, accepted, obligations, that, are, difficult, to, fulfill, and, would, be, dishonorable, to, abandon, yet, because, we, have, acted, in, the, great, liberating, tradition, of, this, nation, tens, of, millions, have, achieved, their, freedom, and, as, hope, kindles, hope, millions, more, will, find, it, by, our, efforts, we, have, lit, a, fire, as, well, a, fire, in, the, minds, of, men, it, warms, those, who, feel, its, power, it, burns, those, who, fight, its, progress, and, one, day, this, untamed, fire, of, freedom, will, reach, the, darkest, corners, of, our, world, a, few, americans, have, accepted, the, hardest, duties, in, this, cause, in, the, quiet, work, of, intelligence, and, diplomacy, the, idealistic, work, of, helping, raise, up, free, governments, the, dangerous, and, necessary, work, of, fighting, our, enemies, some, have, shown, their, devotion, to, our, country, in, deaths, that, honored, their, whole, lives, and, we, will, always, honor, their, names, and, their, sacrifice, all, americans, have, witnessed, this, idealism, and, some, for, the, first, time, i, ask, our, youngest, citizens, to, believe, the, evidence, of, your, eyes, you, have, seen, duty, and, allegiance, in, the, determined, faces, of, our, soldiers, you, have, seen, that, life, is, fragile, and, evil, is, real, and, courage, triumphs, make, the, choice, to, serve, in, a, cause, larger, than, your, wants, larger, than, yourself, and, in, your, days, you, will, add, not, just, to, the, wealth, of, our, country, but, to, its, character, america, has, need, of, idealism, and, courage, because, we, have, essential, work, at, home, the, unfinished, work, of, american, freedom, in, a, world, moving, toward, liberty, we, are, determined, to, show, the, meaning, and, promise, of, liberty, in, america, s, ideal, of, freedom, citizens, find, the, dignity, and, security, of, economic, independence, instead, of, laboring, on, the, edge, of, subsistence, this, is, the, broader, definition, of, liberty, that, motivated, the, homestead, act, the, social, security, act, and, the, gi, bill, of, rights, and, now, we, will, extend, this, vision, by, reforming, great, institutions, to, serve, the, needs, of, our, time, to, give, every, american, a, stake, in, the, promise, and, future, of, our, country, we, will, bring, the, highest, standards, to, our, schools, and, build, an, ownership, society, we, will, widen, the, ownership, of, homes, and, businesses, retirement, savings, and, health, insurance, preparing, our, people, for, the, challenges, of, life, in, a, free, society, by, making, every, citizen, an, agent, of, his, or, her, own, destiny, we, will, give, our, fellow, americans, greater, freedom, from, want, and, fear, and, make, our, society, more, prosperous, and, just, and, equal, in, america, s, ideal, of, freedom, the, public, interest, depends, on, private, character, on, integrity, and, tolerance, toward, others, and, the, rule, of, conscience, in, our, own, lives, self, government, relies, in, the, end, on, the, governing, of, the, self, that, edifice, of, character, is, built, in, families, supported, by, communities, with, standards, and, sustained, in, our, national, life, by, the, truths, of, sinai, the, sermon, on, the, mount, the, words, of, the, koran, and, the, varied, faiths, of, our, people, americans, move, forward, in, every, generation, by, reaffirming, all, that, is, good, and, true, that, came, before, ideals, of, justice, and, conduct, that, are, the, same, yesterday, today, and, forever, in, america, s, ideal, of, freedom, the, exercise, of, rights, is, ennobled, by, service, and, mercy, and, a, heart, for, the, weak, liberty, for, all, does, not, mean, independence, from, one, another, our, nation, relies, on, men, and, women, who, look, after, a, neighbor, and, surround, the, lost, with, love, americans, at, our, best, value, the, life, we, see, in, one, another, and, must, always, remember, that, even, the, unwanted, have, worth, and, our, country, must, abandon, all, the, habits, of, racism, because, we, cannot, carry, the, message, of, freedom, and, the, baggage, of, bigotry, at, the, same, time, from, the, perspective, of, a, single, day, including, this, day, of, dedication, the, issues, and, questions, before, our, country, are, many, from, the, viewpoint, of, centuries, the, questions, that, come, to, us, are, narrowed, and, few, did, our, generation, advance, the, cause, of, freedom, and, did, our, character, bring, credit, to, that, cause, these, questions, that, judge, us, also, unite, us, because, americans, of, every, party, and, background, americans, by, choice, and, by, birth, are, bound, to, one, another, in, the, cause, of, freedom, we, have, known, divisions, which, must, be, healed, to, move, forward, in, great, purposes, and, i, will, strive, in, good, faith, to, heal, them, yet, those, divisions, do, not, define, america, we, felt, the, unity, and, fellowship, of, our, nation, when, freedom, came, under, attack, and, our, response, came, like, a, single, hand, over, a, single, heart, and, we, can, feel, that, same, unity, and, pride, whenever, america, acts, for, good, and, the, victims, of, disaster, are, given, hope, and, the, unjust, encounter, justice, and, the, captives, are, set, free, we, go, forward, with, complete, confidence, in, the, eventual, triumph, of, freedom, not, because, history, runs, on, the, wheels, of, inevitability, it, is, human, choices, that, move, events, not, because, we, consider, ourselves, a, chosen, nation, god, moves, and, chooses, as, he, wills, we, have, confidence, because, freedom, is, the, permanent, hope, of, mankind, the, hunger, in, dark, places, the, longing, of, the, soul, when, our, founders, declared, a, new, order, of, the, ages, when, soldiers, died, in, wave, upon, wave, for, a, union, based, on, liberty, when, citizens, marched, in, peaceful, outrage, under, the, banner, freedom, now, they, were, acting, on, an, ancient, hope, that, is, meant, to, be, fulfilled, history, has, an, ebb, and, flow, of, justice, but, history, also, has, a, visible, direction, set, by, liberty, and, the, author, of, liberty, when, the, declaration, of, independence, was, first, read, in, public, and, the, liberty, bell, was, sounded, in, celebration, a, witness, said, it, rang, as, if, it, meant, something, in, our, time, it, means, something, still, america, in, this, young, century, proclaims, liberty, throughout, all, the, world, and, to, all, the, inhabitants, thereof, renewed, in, our, strength, tested, but, not, weary, we, are, ready, for, the, greatest, achievements, in, the, history, of, freedom, may, god, bless, you, and, may, he, watch,

            "|i stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors i thank president bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition forty-four americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms at these moments america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents so it has been so it must be with this generation of americans that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet these are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that america's decline is inevitable and that the next generation must lower its sights today i say to you that the challenges we face are real they are serious and they are many they will not be met easily or in a short span of time but know this america—they will be met on this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord on this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has come to set aside childish things the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the god-given promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness in reaffirming the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness is never a given it must be earned our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less it has not been the path for the faint-hearted—for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame rather it has been the risk-takers the doers the makers of things—some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom for us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life for us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth for us they fought and died in places like concord and gettysburg normandy and khe sahn time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction this is the journey we continue today we remain the most prosperous powerful nation on earth our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began our minds are no less inventive our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year our capacity remains undiminished but our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions—that time has surely passed starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking america for everywhere we look there is work to be done the state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act—not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth we will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age all this we can do and all this we will do now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions—who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans their memories are short for they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works—whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified where the answer is yes we intend to move forward where the answer is no programs will end and those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control—and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good as for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals our founding fathers faced with perils we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expedience's sake and so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that america is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and that we are ready to lead once more recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions they understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint we are the keepers of this legacy guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort—even greater cooperation and understanding between nations we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in afghanistan with old friends and former foes we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet we will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us and we will defeat you for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness we are a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus and non-believers we are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace to the muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the west know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist to the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect for the world has changed and we must change with it as we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who at this very hour patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains they have something to tell us today just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves and yet at this moment—a moment that will define a generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all for as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours it is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate our challenges may be new the instruments with which we meet them may be new but those values upon which our success depends—hard work and honesty courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism—these things are old these things are true they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history what is demanded then is a return to these truths what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves our nation and the world duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task this is the price and the promise of citizenship this is the source of our confidence—the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed—why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath so let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled in the year of america's birth in the coldest of months a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river the capital was abandoned the enemy was advancing the snow was stained with blood at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people \"let it be told to the future worldthat in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survivethat the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet [it]\" america in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words with hope and virtue let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god's grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america |[i, stand, here, today, humbled, by, the, task, before, us, grateful, for, the, trust, you, have, bestowed, mindful, of, the, sacrifices, borne, by, our, ancestors, i, thank, president, bush, for, his, service, to, our, nation, as, well, as, the, generosity, and, cooperation, he, has, shown, throughout, this, transition, forty, four, americans, have, now, taken, the, presidential, oath, the, words, have, been, spoken, during, rising, tides, of, prosperity, and, the, still, waters, of, peace, yet, every, so, often, the, oath, is, taken, amidst, gathering, clouds, and, raging, storms, at, these, moments, america, has, carried, on, not, simply, because, of, the, skill, or, vision, of, those, in, high, office, but, because, we, the, people, have, remained, faithful, to, the, ideals, of, our, forbearers, and, true, to, our, founding, documents, so, it, has, been, so, it, must, be, with, this, generation, of, americans, that, we, are, in, the, midst, of, crisis, is, now, well, understood, our, nation, is, at, war, against, a, far, reaching, network, of, violence, and, hatred, our, economy, is, badly, weakened, a, consequence, of, greed, and, irresponsibility, on, the, part, of, some, but, also, our, collective, failure, to, make, hard, choices, and, prepare, the, nation, for, a, new, age, homes, have, been, lost, jobs, shed, businesses, shuttered, our, health, care, is, too, costly, our, schools, fail, too, many, and, each, day, brings, further, evidence, that, the, ways, we, use, energy, strengthen, our, adversaries, and, threaten, our, planet, these, are, the, indicators, of, crisis, subject, to, data, and, statistics, less, measurable, but, no, less, profound, is, a, sapping, of, confidence, across, our, land, a, nagging, fear, that, america, s, decline, is, inevitable, and, that, the, next, generation, must, lower, its, sights, today, i, say, to, you, that, the, challenges, we, face, are, real, they, are, serious, and, they, are, many, they, will, not, be, met, easily, or, in, a, short, span, of, time, but, know, this, america, they, will, be, met, on, this, day, we, gather, because, we, have, chosen, hope, over, fear, unity, of, purpose, over, conflict, and, discord, on, this, day, we, come, to, proclaim, an, end, to, the, petty, grievances, and, false, promises, the, recriminations, and, worn, out, dogmas, that, for, far, too, long, have, strangled, our, politics, we, remain, a, young, nation, but, in, the, words, of, scripture, the, time, has, come, to, set, aside, childish, things, the, time, has, come, to, reaffirm, our, enduring, spirit, to, choose, our, better, history, to, carry, forward, that, precious, gift, that, noble, idea, passed, on, from, generation, to, generation, the, god, given, promise, that, all, are, equal, all, are, free, and, all, deserve, a, chance, to, pursue, their, full, measure, of, happiness, in, reaffirming, the, greatness, of, our, nation, we, understand, that, greatness, is, never, a, given, it, must, be, earned, our, journey, has, never, been, one, of, short, cuts, or, settling, for, less, it, has, not, been, the, path, for, the, faint, hearted, for, those, who, prefer, leisure, over, work, or, seek, only, the, pleasures, of, riches, and, fame, rather, it, has, been, the, risk, takers, the, doers, the, makers, of, things, some, celebrated, but, more, often, men, and, women, obscure, in, their, labor, who, have, carried, us, up, the, long, rugged, path, towards, prosperity, and, freedom, for, us, they, packed, up, their, few, worldly, possessions, and, traveled, across, oceans, in, search, of, a, new, life, for, us, they, toiled, in, sweatshops, and, settled, the, west, endured, the, lash, of, the, whip, and, plowed, the, hard, earth, for, us, they, fought, and, died, in, places, like, concord, and, gettysburg, normandy, and, khe, sahn, time, and, again, these, men, and, women, struggled, and, sacrificed, and, worked, till, their, hands, were, raw, so, that, we, might, live, a, better, life, they, saw, america, as, bigger, than, the, sum, of, our, individual, ambitions, greater, than, all, the, differences, of, birth, or, wealth, or, faction, this, is, the, journey, we, continue, today, we, remain, the, most, prosperous, powerful, nation, on, earth, our, workers, are, no, less, productive, than, when, this, crisis, began, our, minds, are, no, less, inventive, our, goods, and, services, no, less, needed, than, they, were, last, week, or, last, month, or, last, year, our, capacity, remains, undiminished, but, our, time, of, standing, pat, of, protecting, narrow, interests, and, putting, off, unpleasant, decisions, that, time, has, surely, passed, starting, today, we, must, pick, ourselves, up, dust, ourselves, off, and, begin, again, the, work, of, remaking, america, for, everywhere, we, look, there, is, work, to, be, done, the, state, of, the, economy, calls, for, action, bold, and, swift, and, we, will, act, not, only, to, create, new, jobs, but, to, lay, a, new, foundation, for, growth, we, will, build, the, roads, and, bridges, the, electric, grids, and, digital, lines, that, feed, our, commerce, and, bind, us, together, we, will, restore, science, to, its, rightful, place, and, wield, technology, s, wonders, to, raise, health, care, s, quality, and, lower, its, cost, we, will, harness, the, sun, and, the, winds, and, the, soil, to, fuel, our, cars, and, run, our, factories, and, we, will, transform, our, schools, and, colleges, and, universities, to, meet, the, demands, of, a, new, age, all, this, we, can, do, and, all, this, we, will, do, now, there, are, some, who, question, the, scale, of, our, ambitions, who, suggest, that, our, system, cannot, tolerate, too, many, big, plans, their, memories, are, short, for, they, have, forgotten, what, this, country, has, already, done, what, free, men, and, women, can, achieve, when, imagination, is, joined, to, common, purpose, and, necessity, to, courage, what, the, cynics, fail, to, understand, is, that, the, ground, has, shifted, beneath, them, that, the, stale, political, arguments, that, have, consumed, us, for, so, long, no, longer, apply, the, question, we, ask, today, is, not, whether, our, government, is, too, big, or, too, small, but, whether, it, works, whether, it, helps, families, find, jobs, at, a, decent, wage, care, they, can, afford, a, retirement, that, is, dignified, where, the, answer, is, yes, we, intend, to, move, forward, where, the, answer, is, no, programs, will, end, and, those, of, us, who, manage, the, public, s, dollars, will, be, held, to, account, to, spend, wisely, reform, bad, habits, and, do, our, business, in, the, light, of, day, because, only, then, can, we, restore, the, vital, trust, between, a, people, and, their, government, nor, is, the, question, before, us, whether, the, market, is, a, force, for, good, or, ill, its, power, to, generate, wealth, and, expand, freedom, is, unmatched, but, this, crisis, has, reminded, us, that, without, a, watchful, eye, the, market, can, spin, out, of, control, and, that, a, nation, cannot, prosper, long, when, it, favors, only, the, prosperous, the, success, of, our, economy, has, always, depended, not, just, on, the, size, of, our, gross, domestic, product, but, on, the, reach, of, our, prosperity, on, our, ability, to, extend, opportunity, to, every, willing, heart, not, out, of, charity, but, because, it, is, the, surest, route, to, our, common, good, as, for, our, common, defense, we, reject, as, false, the, choice, between, our, safety, and, our, ideals, our, founding, fathers, faced, with, perils, we, can, scarcely, imagine, drafted, a, charter, to, assure, the, rule, of, law, and, the, rights, of, man, a, charter, expanded, by, the, blood, of, generations, those, ideals, still, light, the, world, and, we, will, not, give, them, up, for, expedience, s, sake, and, so, to, all, other, peoples, and, governments, who, are, watching, today, from, the, grandest, capitals, to, the, small, village, where, my, father, was, born, know, that, america, is, a, friend, of, each, nation, and, every, man, woman, and, child, who, seeks, a, future, of, peace, and, dignity, and, that, we, are, ready, to, lead, once, more, recall, that, earlier, generations, faced, down, fascism, and, communism, not, just, with, missiles, and, tanks, but, with, sturdy, alliances, and, enduring, convictions, they, understood, that, our, power, alone, cannot, protect, us, nor, does, it, entitle, us, to, do, as, we, please, instead, they, knew, that, our, power, grows, through, its, prudent, use, our, security, emanates, from, the, justness, of, our, cause, the, force, of, our, example, the, tempering, qualities, of, humility, and, restraint, we, are, the, keepers, of, this, legacy, guided, by, these, principles, once, more, we, can, meet, those, new, threats, that, demand, even, greater, effort, even, greater, cooperation, and, understanding, between, nations, we, will, begin, to, responsibly, leave, iraq, to, its, people, and, forge, a, hard, earned, peace, in, afghanistan, with, old, friends, and, former, foes, we, will, work, tirelessly, to, lessen, the, nuclear, threat, and, roll, back, the, specter, of, a, warming, planet, we, will, not, apologize, for, our, way, of, life, nor, will, we, waver, in, its, defense, and, for, those, who, seek, to, advance, their, aims, by, inducing, terror, and, slaughtering, innocents, we, say, to, you, now, that, our, spirit, is, stronger, and, cannot, be, broken, you, cannot, outlast, us, and, we, will, defeat, you, for, we, know, that, our, patchwork, heritage, is, a, strength, not, a, weakness, we, are, a, nation, of, christians, and, muslims, jews, and, hindus, and, non, believers, we, are, shaped, by, every, language, and, culture, drawn, from, every, end, of, this, earth, and, because, we, have, tasted, the, bitter, swill, of, civil, war, and, segregation, and, emerged, from, that, dark, chapter, stronger, and, more, united, we, cannot, help, but, believe, that, the, old, hatreds, shall, someday, pass, that, the, lines, of, tribe, shall, soon, dissolve, that, as, the, world, grows, smaller, our, common, humanity, shall, reveal, itself, and, that, america, must, play, its, role, in, ushering, in, a, new, era, of, peace, to, the, muslim, world, we, seek, a, new, way, forward, based, on, mutual, interest, and, mutual, respect, to, those, leaders, around, the, globe, who, seek, to, sow, conflict, or, blame, their, society, s, ills, on, the, west, know, that, your, people, will, judge, you, on, what, you, can, build, not, what, you, destroy, to, those, who, cling, to, power, through, corruption, and, deceit, and, the, silencing, of, dissent, know, that, you, are, on, the, wrong, side, of, history, but, that, we, will, extend, a, hand, if, you, are, willing, to, unclench, your, fist, to, the, people, of, poor, nations, we, pledge, to, work, alongside, you, to, make, your, farms, flourish, and, let, clean, waters, flow, to, nourish, starved, bodies, and, feed, hungry, minds, and, to, those, nations, like, ours, that, enjoy, relative, plenty, we, say, we, can, no, longer, afford, indifference, to, suffering, outside, our, borders, nor, can, we, consume, the, world, s, resources, without, regard, to, effect, for, the, world, has, changed, and, we, must, change, with, it, as, we, consider, the, road, that, unfolds, before, us, we, remember, with, humble, gratitude, those, brave, americans, who, at, this, very, hour, patrol, far, off, deserts, and, distant, mountains, they, have, something, to, tell, us, today, just, as, the, fallen, heroes, who, lie, in, arlington, whisper, through, the, ages, we, honor, them, not, only, because, they, are, guardians, of, our, liberty, but, because, they, embody, the, spirit, of, service, a, willingness, to, find, meaning, in, something, greater, than, themselves, and, yet, at, this, moment, a, moment, that, will, define, a, generation, it, is, precisely, this, spirit, that, must, inhabit, us, all, for, as, much, as, government, can, do, and, must, do, it, is, ultimately, the, faith, and, determination, of, the, american, people, upon, which, this, nation, relies, it, is, the, kindness, to, take, in, a, stranger, when, the, levees, break, the, selflessness, of, workers, who, would, rather, cut, their, hours, than, see, a, friend, lose, their, job, which, sees, us, through, our, darkest, hours, it, is, the, firefighter, s, courage, to, storm, a, stairway, filled, with, smoke, but, also, a, parent, s, willingness, to, nurture, a, child, that, finally, decides, our, fate, our, challenges, may, be, new, the, instruments, with, which, we, meet, them, may, be, new, but, those, values, upon, which, our, success, depends, hard, work, and, honesty, courage, and, fair, play, tolerance, and, curiosity, loyalty, and, patriotism, these, things, are, old, these, things, are, true, they, have, been, the, quiet, force, of, progress, throughout, our, history, what, is, demanded, then, is, a, return, to, these, truths, what, is, required, of, us, now, is, a, new, era, of, responsibility, a, recognition, on, the, part, of, every, american, that, we, have, duties, to, ourselves, our, nation, and, the, world, duties, that, we, do, not, grudgingly, accept, but, rather, seize, gladly, firm, in, the, knowledge, that, there, is, nothing, so, satisfying, to, the, spirit, so, defining, of, our, character, than, giving, our, all, to, a, difficult, task, this, is, the, price, and, the, promise, of, citizenship, this, is, the, source, of, our, confidence, the, knowledge, that, god, calls, on, us, to, shape, an, uncertain, destiny, this, is, the, meaning, of, our, liberty, and, our, creed, why, men, and, women, and, children, of, every, race, and, every, faith, can, join, in, celebration, across, this, magnificent, mall, and, why, a, man, whose, father, less, than, sixty, years, ago, might, not, have, been, served, at, a, local, restaurant, can, now, stand, before, you, to, take, a, most, sacred, oath, so, let, us, mark, this, day, with, remembrance, of, who, we, are, and, how, far, we, have, traveled, in, the, year, of, america, s, birth, in, the, coldest, of, months, a, small, band, of, patriots, huddled, by, dying, campfires, on, the, shores, of, an, icy, river, the, capital, was, abandoned, the, enemy, was, advancing, the, snow, was, stained, with, blood, at, a, moment, when, the, outcome, of, our, revolution, was, most, in, doubt, the, father, of, our, nation, ordered, these, words, be, read, to, the, people, let, it, be, told, to, the, future, worldthat, in, the, depth, of, winter, when, nothing, but, hope, and, virtue, could, survivethat, the, city, and, the, country, alarmed, at, one, common, danger, came, forth, to, meet, it, america, in, the, face, of, our, common, dangers, in, this, winter, of, our, hardship, let, us, remember, these, timeless, words, with, hope, and, virtue, let, us, brave, once, more, the, icy, currents, and, endure, what, storms, may, come, let, it, be, said, by, our, children, s, children, that, when, we, were, tested, we, refused, to, let, this, journey, end, that, we, did, not, turn, back, nor, did, we, falter, and, with, eyes, fixed, on, the, horizon, and, god, s, grace, upon, us, we, carried, forth, that, great, gift, of, freedom, and, delivered, it, safely, to, future, generations, thank, you, god, bless, you, and, may, god, bless, the, united, states, of, america]|2410

            "|president clinton distinguished guests and my fellow citizens the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history yet common in our country with a simple oath we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings as i begin i thank president clinton for his service to our nation and i thank vice president gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace i am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of america's leaders have come before me and so many will follow we have a place all of us in a long story a story we continue but whose end we will not see it is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess to defend but not to conquer it is the american story a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals the grandest of these ideals is an unfolding american promise that everyone belongs that everyone deserves a chance that no insignificant person was ever born americans are called upon to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws and though our nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed we must follow no other course through much of the last century america's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea now it is a seed upon the wind taking root in many nations our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country it is the inborn hope of our humanity an ideal we carry but do not own a trust we bear and pass along and even after nearly 225 years we have a long way yet to travel while many of our citizens prosper others doubt the promise even the justice of our own country the ambitions of some americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth and sometimes our differences run so deep it seems we share a continent but not a country we do not accept this and we will not allow it our unity our union is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation and this is my solemn pledge i will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity i know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in his image and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward america has never been united by blood or birth or soil we are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens every child must be taught these principles every citizen must uphold them and every immigrant by embracing these ideals makes our country more not less american today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility courage compassion and character america at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility a civil society demands from each of us good will and respect fair dealing and forgiveness some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stakes of our debates appear small but the stakes for america are never small if our country does not lead the cause of freedom it will not be led if we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism if we permit our economy to drift and decline the vulnerable will suffer most we must live up to the calling we share civility is not a tactic or a sentiment it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism of community over chaos this commitment if we keep it is a way to shared accomplishment america at its best is also courageous our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war when defending common dangers defined our common good now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us we must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations together we will reclaim america's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives we will reform social security and medicare sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working americans we will build our defenses beyond challenge lest weakness invite challenge and we will confront weapons of mass destruction so that a new century is spared new horrors the enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake america remains engaged in the world by history and by choice shaping a balance of power that favors freedom we will defend our allies and our interests we will show purpose without arrogance we will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength and to all nations we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth america at its best is compassionate in the quiet of american conscience we know that deep persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise whatever our views of its cause we can agree that children at risk are not at fault abandonment and abuse are not acts of god they are failures of love the proliferation of prisons however necessary is no substitute for hope and order in our souls where there is suffering there is duty americans in need are not strangers they are citizens not problems but priorities and all of us are diminished when any are hopeless government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health for civil rights and common schools yet compassion is the work of a nation not just a government some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer church and charity synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws many in our country do not know the pain of poverty but we can listen to those who do i can pledge our nation to a goal when we see that wounded traveler on the road to jericho we will not pass to the other side america at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats it is a call to conscience though it requires sacrifice it brings a deeper fulfillment we find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free our public interest depends on private character on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness on uncounted unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom sometimes in life we are called to do great things but as a saint of our times has said every day we are called to do small things with great love the most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone i will live and lead by these principles to advance my convictions with civility to pursue the public interest with courage to speak for greater justice and compassion to call for responsibility and try to live it as well in all of these ways i will bring the values of our history to the care of our times what you do is as important as anything government does i ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort to defend needed reforms against easy attacks to serve your nation beginning with your neighbor i ask you to be citizens citizens not spectators citizens not subjects responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character americans are generous and strong and decent not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves when this spirit of citizenship is missing no government program can replace it when this spirit is present no wrong can stand against it after the declaration of independence was signed virginia statesman john page wrote to thomas jefferson we know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm much time has passed since jefferson arrived for his inauguration the years and changes accumulate but the themes of this day he would know our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity we are not this story's author who fills time and eternity with his purpose yet his purpose is achieved in our duty and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another never tiring never yielding never finishing we renew that purpose today to make our country more just and generous to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life this work continues this story goes on and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm god bless you all and god bless america

authority, is, rare, in, history, yet, common, in, our, country, with, a, simple, oath, we, affirm, old, traditions, and, make, new, beginnings, as, i, begin, i, thank, president, clinton, for, his, service, to, our, nation, and, i, thank, vice, president, gore, for, a, contest, conducted, with, spirit, and, ended, with, grace, i, am, honored, and, humbled, to, stand, here, where, so, many, of, america, s, leaders, have, come, before, me, and, so, many, will, follow, we, have, a, place, all, of, us, in, a, long, story, a, story, we, continue, but, whose, end, we, will, not, see, it, is, the, story, of, a, new, world, that, became, a, friend, and, liberator, of, the, old, a, story, of, a, slave, holding, society, that, became, a, servant, of, freedom, the, story, of, a, power, that, went, into, the, world, to, protect, but, not, possess, to, defend, but, not, to, conquer, it, is, the, american, story, a, story, of, flawed, and, fallible, people, united, across, the, generations, by, grand, and, enduring, ideals, the, grandest, of, these, ideals, is, an, unfolding, american, promise, that, everyone, belongs, that, everyone, deserves, a, chance, that, no, insignificant, person, was, ever, born, americans, are, called, upon, to, enact, this, promise, in, our, lives, and, in, our, laws, and, though, our, nation, has, sometimes, halted, and, sometimes, delayed, we, must, follow, no, other, course, through, much, of, the, last, century, america, s, faith, in, freedom, and, democracy, was, a, rock, in, a, raging, sea, now, it, is, a, seed, upon, the, wind, taking, root, in, many, nations, our, democratic, faith, is, more, than, the, creed, of, our, country, it, is, the, inborn, hope, of, our, humanity, an, ideal, we, carry, but, do, not, own, a, trust, we, bear, and, pass, along, and, even, after, nearly, 225, years, we, have, a, long, way, yet, to, travel, while, many, of, our, citizens, prosper, others, doubt, the, promise, even, the, justice, of, our, own, country, the, ambitions, of, some, americans, are, limited, by, failing, schools, and, hidden, prejudice, and, the, circumstances, of, their, birth, and, sometimes, our, differences, run, so, deep, it, seems, we, share, a, continent, but, not, a, country, we, do, not, accept, this, and, we, will, not, allow, it, our, unity, our, union, is, the, serious, work, of, leaders, and, citizens, in, every, generation, and, this, is, my, solemn, pledge, i, will, work, to, build, a, single, nation, of, justice, and, opportunity, i, know, this, is, in, our, reach, because, we, are, guided, by, a, power, larger, than, ourselves, who, creates, us, equal, in, his, image, and, we, are, confident, in, principles, that, unite, and, lead, us, onward, america, has, never, been, united, by, blood, or, birth, or, soil, we, are, bound, by, ideals, that, move, us, beyond, our, backgrounds, lift, us, above, our, interests, and, teach, us, what, it, means, to, be, citizens, every, child, must, be, taught, these, principles, every, citizen, must, uphold, them, and, every, immigrant, by, embracing, these, ideals, makes, our, country, more, not, less, american, today, we, affirm, a, new, commitment, to, live, out, our, nation, s, promise, through, civility, courage, compassion, and, character, america, at, its, best, matches, a, commitment, to, principle, with, a, concern, for, civility, a, civil, society, demands, from, each, of, us, good, will, and, respect, fair, dealing, and, forgiveness, some, seem, to, believe, that, our, politics, can, afford, to, be, petty, because, in, a, time, of, peace, the, stakes, of, our, debates, appear, small, but, the, stakes, for, america, are, never, small, if, our, country, does, not, lead, the, cause, of, freedom, it, will, not, be, led, if, we, do, not, turn, the, hearts, of, children, toward, knowledge, and, character, we, will, lose, their, gifts, and, undermine, their, idealism, if, we, permit, our, economy, to, drift, and, decline, the, vulnerable, will, suffer, most, we, must, live, up, to, the, calling, we, share, civility, is, not, a, tactic, or, a, sentiment, it, is, the, determined, choice, of, trust, over, cynicism, of, community, over, chaos, this, commitment, if, we, keep, it, is, a, way, to, shared, accomplishment, america, at, its, best, is, also, courageous, our, national, courage, has, been, clear, in, times, of, depression, and, war, when, defending, common, dangers, defined, our, common, good, now, we, must, choose, if, the, example, of, our, fathers, and, mothers, will, inspire, us, or, condemn, us, we, must, show, courage, in, a, time, of, blessing, by, confronting, problems, instead, of, passing, them, on, to, future, generations, together, we, will, reclaim, america, s, schools, before, ignorance, and, apathy, claim, more, young, lives, we, will, reform, social, security, and, medicare, sparing, our, children, from, struggles, we, have, the, power, to, prevent, we, will, reduce, taxes, to, recover, the, momentum, of, our, economy, and, reward, the, effort, and, enterprise, of, working, americans, we, will, build, our, defenses, beyond, challenge, lest, weakness, invite, challenge, and, we, will, confront, weapons, of, mass, destruction, so, that, a, new, century, is, spared, new, horrors, the, enemies, of, liberty, and, our, country, should, make, no, mistake, america, remains, engaged, in, the, world, by, history, and, by, choice, shaping, a, balance, of, power, that, favors, freedom, we, will, defend, our, allies, and, our, interests, we, will, show, purpose, without, arrogance, we, will, meet, aggression, and, bad, faith, with, resolve, and, strength, and, to, all, nations, we, will, speak, for, the, values, that, gave, our, nation, birth, america, at, its, best, is, compassionate, in, the, quiet, of, american, conscience, we, know, that, deep, persistent, poverty, is, unworthy, of, our, nation, s, promise, whatever, our, views, of, its, cause, we, can, agree, that, children, at, risk, are, not, at, fault, abandonment, and, abuse, are, not, acts, of, god, they, are, failures, of, love, the, proliferation, of, prisons, however, necessary, is, no, substitute, for, hope, and, order, in, our, souls, where, there, is, suffering, there, is, duty, americans, in, need, are, not, strangers, they, are, citizens, not, problems, but, priorities, and, all, of, us, are, diminished, when, any, are, hopeless, government, has, great, responsibilities, for, public, safety, and, public, health, for, civil, rights, and, common, schools, yet, compassion, is, the, work, of, a, nation, not, just, a, government, some, needs, and, hurts, are, so, deep, they, will, only, respond, to, a, mentor, s, touch, or, a, pastor, s, prayer, church, and, charity, synagogue, and, mosque, lend, our, communities, their, humanity, and, they, will, have, an, honored, place, in, our, plans, and, in, our, laws, many, in, our, country, do, not, know, the, pain, of, poverty, but, we, can, listen, to, those, who, do, i, can, pledge, our, nation, to, a, goal, when, we, see, that, wounded, traveler, on, the, road, to, jericho, we, will, not, pass, to, the, other, side, america, at, its, best, is, a, place, where, personal, responsibility, is, valued, and, expected, encouraging, responsibility, is, not, a, search, for, scapegoats, it, is, a, call, to, conscience, though, it, requires, sacrifice, it, brings, a, deeper, fulfillment, we, find, the, fullness, of, life, not, only, in, options, but, in, commitments, we, find, that, children, and, community, are, the, commitments, that, set, us, free, our, public, interest, depends, on, private, character, on, civic, duty, and, family, bonds, and, basic, fairness, on, uncounted, unhonored, acts, of, decency, which, give, direction, to, our, freedom, sometimes, in, life, we, are, called, to, do, great, things, but, as, a, saint, of, our, times, has, said, every, day, we, are, called, to, do, small, things, with, great, love, the, most, important, tasks, of, a, democracy, are, done, by, everyone, i, will, live, and, lead, by, these, principles, to, advance, my, convictions, with, civility, to, pursue, the, public, interest, with, courage, to, speak, for, greater, justice, and, compassion, to, call, for, responsibility, and, try, to, live, it, as, well, in, all, of, these,
